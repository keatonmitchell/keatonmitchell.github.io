  <a href="topoMap/topoMap.html"> Topographic Map Generator (procedural art)</a> <br>
  A site that generates a topographic map. <br>
  Feel free to use any or all of the source code. <br>
  Inspired by <a href="writing/The Wireframe God.pdf"> The Wireframe God</a>. <br>
  <br>
  <a href="/writing/ZUGZWANG.pdf"> ZUGZWANG (1-act play)</a> <br> 
  A surreal comedy about a person who cannot win a game of chess. <br>
  Even as the show's narrator continually explains how to play like a master, <br>
  this unnamed novice gradually discovers that none of it helps whatsoever. <br>
  What do you do when there is nothing to do but fail? It's quite simple. <br>
  <br>
  <a href="spaceGame/index.html"> Gravity Platformer (minigame)</a> <br>
  A simulator of 2D planetary motion. Use WASD to move and SPACE to jump <br>
  Originally this was meant to be a full game, but this is all, I think, it will ever become. <br>
  As always, feel free to use anything you find. <br>
  <br>
  <a href="https://this-immortal-coil.web.app"> This Immortal Coil (full game)</a> <br>
  A game I made in high school. <br>
  It's a hack and slash boss rush. When you die you go back to the beginning. <br>
  If the game glitches out, try resizing the window. <br>
