Richardson paced, checking his watch every five minutes. 6:00...
6:05... 6:10. “Tom, check around the building.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Just
did,” said Tom Baker Brown. “Just got back.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Check
again,” he said. And when Tom returned, “Real sportsmanlike,
ditching the on meeting you call, and on Christmas Eve no less.
Better be important. Also, what kind of a place is this?”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“This
is behind the Home Depot,” said Tom. Joules grunted. He’d been
told to stop holding meetings behind the Home Depot, but he didn’t
choose the location this time.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	At
exactly 6:30, the boy who called himself Newt arrived.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Mr.
Joules.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Mr.
Newt, hello. Can we get this over with?”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Well,
Mr. Joules, I have it on good understanding that one of your boys
licked one of my boys in <i>my territory</i>.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Who?”
Joules sat down on the curb.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Johnny
Herringsworth. Was supposed to be one of the good ones.” Newt held
out his hand. Joules put 2 dollars in it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Look,
whaddaya want? I’ll give you an extra dollar and leash him by the
ear. He’s going through it, right? It’s tough times for his
folks. You think he’s getting anything for Christmas?”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“I
don’t give a darn what he’s getting for Christmas,” said Newt.
“Rules are. And for too long you’ve been pretending like they
weren’t, letting your boys run around like a litter of stray cats.
Lately, it’s been getting worse. And don’t try to peg this on me,
‘cause you would. This is your problem. You need to fix it.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Well
maybe,” Joules stood back up, “maybe, if every one of you
wouldn’t pick on us the moment we enter your territory, there
wouldn’t be so many fights! This is one town, you know; not two.
There’s, for example, there’s only one auto shop that also has a
public bathroom. Only one. That’s real important to Johnny. You
wanna guess where it is? Your side. Your side, Newt.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	Newt
stared at Joules. Finally, Joules sat back down. Newt said, “Fine.
There’s gonna be a battle between our sides, no one else. Bring
anyone and everyone. It’ll be noon on the 26<sup>th</sup>, can’t
do tomorrow. As for location, why don’t we say... outside your
precious auto shop with a public bathroom? I knew this would happen.
I’ve already told my side.” Then, as quickly as he had appeared,
Newt vanished.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	Joules,
scowling, stood up and began to pace again. “We can beat them. We
can beat them.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Maybe,”
said Tom. “We got a lot of good guys out of town.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	Joules
said, “Yeah. Let’s go.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Halt!”
sounded behind them, just as they were going to leave. “Halt!
Joules and Tom, I should have known. Come back here.” It was Police
Chief Haydermeyer. “Got a call saying two young boys were acting
all suspicious-like back here. Wouldn’t happen to know anything
about that, would you?”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	Joules
looked at the curb, frowned, and sat. “Meeting with Newt. He called
the location. You can ask him yourself.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“If
I can ask him, where is he? Caller said he looked and there were two
boys, and he kept looking every five minutes for a half hour and
there were always two boys. Newt not show up?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“No,”
said Joules. “He did. It took a half an hour.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Stand
up, boy!” Joules stood. Mr. Haydermeyer leaned down to look him in
the face. “Even if I believed you, which I don’t, I could still
arrest you a dozen different ways. Rules exist. It is my job to
enforce them, and, apparently, it is your job to pretend they aren’t
there. Give me one reason not to take you in right now.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“All
that paperwork on Christmas Eve,” guessed Joules. He wasn’t sure
how much work it is to arrest someone.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Hmm...”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“There’s
gonna be a fight!” Joules continued, “I have information too.
There’s gonna be a fight, day after tomorrow. Me and Newt and our
gangs. To decide,  I, I, I guess, if they get to pick on us. At noon,
go to the parking lot in front of the Arthur A. Auto. We’re gonna
smoke them good; you can try to arrest me then.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Hmph!”
said Mr. Haydermeyer. “We’ll see if you’re right. I reckon I
could take in several more than the two boys there. If not... I know
where you live.” The police chief stormed away.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	Joules
sighed. He sat on the curb. “Look, my hand is shaking. Have to get
that sorted out.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	Tom
asked, “You’re really gonna let him take you?”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“No,
I’ll get away. I said I’d let him <i>try </i><span style="font-style: normal">to
arrest me.” They sat there a few more minutes, until Joules took
his face out of his hands, </span><span style="font-style: normal">stood</span><span style="font-style: normal">
and said, “Let’s split, man. We can tell–”</span></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Halt!” They were prevented
from leaving again, only this time the voice was a squeak, and spoke
in an accent neither boy could place. “Halt! You are the residents
of this miserable city, are you not?” The boys looked around for
their inquisitor, and they looked around again. Finally, Tom realized
it was a raccoon who was talking.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Yeah...?” said Joules.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Then you shall be their
representative. Be advised that the animal revolution will take place
the day after tomorrow, in the middle of the day, at the building
entitled...” the raccoon produced a paper and slowly read from it.
Joules sat. “Arthur A. Auto. For too long the humans have
subjugated the animals. For too long, taken their forests. For too
long the humans have built their own concrete forests and not allowed
animals to compete. If we can take it, the building shall be ours!
Huzzah! What say you?”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	Joules processed, “Yes,
well... fine, but couldn’t you postpone it another day? At least,
like a couple of hours? We, um...”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Pah!” cried the raccoon.
“We shall attack, when we shall attack! We animals care not for
your human ‘holidays’; if it inconveniences you to defend
yourselves, then we shall gain advantage all the more. Rules are
immutable, human. They are created by nature herself. Humans have
tried to alter the rules, to change them to their own design, but no
more! The animals shall rule again. Good day, sir. And the other
sir.” The raccoon backed away without turning around, and when it
reached the trees bolted for its life.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“Thing was scared,” said
Tom. “I didn’t realize.”</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	Joules said, “We got something
in common, then. I don’t know what’s going on. Tom, tell me
what’s going on.”</font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	“You’re gonna be up against

<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	The night of Christmas Eve is
often written about. It is a peaceful night, they say, when not even
the mice wake up to do their regular excursions. It is a bounteous
night, but superior to that bounteous day, Christmas, for at night
the gifts are only limited by a child’s imagination. It is a night,
more than anything, of hope.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	But for Joules, Tom, Newt,
Haydermeyer, and the raccoon, it was a night of worry. Neither Joules
nor Newt was sure they could fin the fight, and Newt secretly
regretted scheduling it the day after Christmas. Haydermeyer
suspected Joules had fed him false information and was already
running away. The raccoon knew that the animal revolution would not
succeed. Everyone worried about their own woe, and Joules worried
about all three. But they were worrying about the wrong thing.</font></p>

the water carried all sorts of stuff with it and dropped the stuff

reveals more bark underneath. And you pull that off, more underneath
yet. I’ve never made it to the bottom. But the water, the water

<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	Christmas was not celebrated
that year, except by a few families. Many gifts sat in spare rooms,

<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	Shoelace and Young Nathan held a
burial for the drowned fish. It was quite an event; the six major
groups were there, and even Newt made an appearance. After the hole
was filled in, Young Nathan said this: “All the fish that were
stranded in the air are now free. They can go back to their houses,
metaphorically. Stranding fish is wrong. Today, we have tried to fix
that. But, everyone, remember: one day, more fish will be stranded in
the air. When that happens, we need to bury them too.” By the time
of the next flood, everyone had forgotten this speech.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	The animal revolution was
officially postponed, and Joules was notified of this.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	There were whisperings of what
caused the flood, of course, and whether it could have been stopped,
and who failed to predict it. There are always such whisperings. It’s
best not to write about them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">	As to the fight that was going
to occur, and the police sting, and the animal revolution, all at the
same time and the same place: no one showed up. It was a very simple
affair. Neither any people nor any animals were present at the
appointed time, and none showed up late. Joules remembered later, and
sent Newt an apology, and, the next day, received a similar apology
back. They intended to meet and set a new date, but, for whatever
reason, that meeting never seemed to occur. </font>
